# Document Clustering Using Word Embedding Techniques
Introduction
This project presents a workflow for optimizing document clustering using various word embedding techniques. The primary goal is to overcome challenges associated with document clustering by employing different word embedding methods, ultimately improving the accuracy and efficiency of text data analysis.

Background
Analyzing large volumes of text data is crucial in the digital age. Traditional text analysis methods, which depend heavily on manual review, are time-consuming and inefficient, especially when handling large datasets with numerous duplicates and variations. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automate document classification and clustering, making the process more efficient.

Objectives
Develop a robust system for document clustering and analysis.
Integrate feature extraction, pre-processing, word embedding, clustering algorithms, and visualization techniques.
Assess and contrast several word embedding techniques, such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and GloVe.
Provide insights into the effectiveness of different word embedding techniques in document clustering.
Methodology
The workflow includes the following steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering and cleaning text data.
Word Embedding Techniques: Implementing various embedding methods (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe).
Co-Occurrence Matrix Construction: Building matrices to capture word relationships.
Dimensionality Reduction: Applying techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensions.
Clustering: Using K-Means clustering to group similar documents.
Tools and Libraries
Python: Chosen for its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
Numpy and Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
Scikit-learn: For implementing clustering algorithms and preprocessing techniques.
Gensim: For Word2Vec embeddings.
Spacy: For advanced NLP tasks and GloVe embeddings.
Matplotlib: For data visualization to evaluate clustering results.
Dataset
The dataset consists of five documents covering different subjects: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Diet, and Sleep Schedule. Each document provides insights into its respective topic, ranging from technological advancements and applications to health and wellness.

Results
Text Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include tokenization, normalization, stopword removal, and stemming to clean and standardize the text.

Word Embedding Techniques
Bag of Words: Converts text into a matrix of token counts.
TF-IDF: Measures the importance of terms within the documents.
Word2Vec: Captures semantic relationships between words.
GloVe: Represents words in a continuous vector space based on their co-occurrence.
Clustering Evaluation
Silhouette Score: Measures the quality of clustering by comparing the distance between data points and their own cluster versus other clusters.
Davies-Bouldin Index: Evaluates clustering quality by comparing the ratio of within-cluster dispersion to between-cluster separation.
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of different word embedding techniques for document clustering. The findings contribute to the field of NLP by offering insights into the effectiveness of these techniques, paving the way for more advanced and automated document analysis solutions.
